# Course Code Generation

The goal of this project is to provide a system to generate course codes for the various courses being taught in an educational institution. This is done by dividing the code into components that are generated based off the details of the courses themselves

## Description

A course code can be broken down into 7 components as shown below.

These segments are generated depending the parameters that have been entered, such as the semester the course is being taught it, or the number of departments it is being offered to. The uniqueness of the codes are maintained by performing checks with existing permutations and the altered as and when required.
